# 🧪 Customer Segmentation Using k-Means Clustering  
### 📌 Unsupervised Machine Learning Project

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical business strategy used to understand customer behavior and target them effectively.

In this project, I implemented **k-Means Clustering**, an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm**, to group mall customers based on their **annual income** and **spending behavior**.

This project demonstrates how **unsupervised learning works in real-world business scenarios** where **no labeled data is available**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and apply **unsupervised machine learning**
- Segment customers into **meaningful groups**
- Choose the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**
- Visualize customer segments clearly
- Interpret clusters from a **business perspective**

## 📂 Dataset Information

**Dataset Name:** Mall Customer Segmentation Data  
**Source:** Kaggle  

### 📊 Dataset Columns

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| CustomerID | Unique customer identifier |
| Gender | Male / Female |
| Age | Age of the customer |
| Annual Income (k$) | Yearly income |
| Spending Score (1–100) | Spending behavior score |

### 📌 Features Used for Clustering

- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1–100)**

These features best represent **customer purchasing behavior**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **“Group mall customers into different segments based on their income and spending habits so businesses can target them more effectively.”**

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Load the dataset and inspect the data  
2️⃣ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3️⃣ Select relevant numerical features  
4️⃣ Apply feature scaling using **StandardScaler**  
5️⃣ Determine optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
6️⃣ Train the **k-Means clustering model**  
7️⃣ Assign cluster labels to each customer  
8️⃣ Visualize customer segments  
9️⃣ Interpret clusters for business insights

## 📊 Cluster Interpretation (Business Insights)

| Cluster | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Cluster 0 | High income, high spending (VIP customers) |
| Cluster 1 | Low income, low spending |
| Cluster 2 | High income, low spending (careful customers) |
| Cluster 3 | Low income, high spending (impulsive buyers) |
| Cluster 4 | Average income and spending customers |

📌 These insights help businesses design **personalized marketing strategies** and improve customer targeting.
